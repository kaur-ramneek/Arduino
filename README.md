#TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM
Traffic lights, also known as traffic signals, traffic lamps, traffic semaphore, signal lights, stop lights,  and traffic control signals (in technical parlance), are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control flows of traffic.
 Traffic lights alternate the right of way accorded to users by displaying lights of a standard colour (red, amber (yellow), and green) following a universal color code. In the typical sequence of colour phases:
•	The green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted, if it is safe to do so and there is room on the other side of the intersection.
•	The amber (yellow) light warns that the signal is about to change to red. In a number of countries – among them the United Kingdom – a phase during which red and yellow are displayed together indicates that the signal is about to change to green. Actions required by drivers on a yellow light vary, with some jurisdictions requiring drivers to stop if it is safe to do so, and others allowing drivers to go through the intersection if safe to do so.
•	A flashing amber indication is a warning signal. In the United Kingdom, a flashing amber light is used only at pelican crossings, in place of the combined red–amber signal, and indicates that drivers may pass if no pedestrians are on the crossing.
•	The red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding.
•	A flashing red indication is treated as a stop sign.
